												A pebble bed reactor is a very high temperature, gas-cooled reactor still in its experimental phase in the US. 
												The fuel pebbles contain Uranium or Thorium embedded within graphite. 
												The fuel enters through the top of the reactor and over long periods of time migrates towards the bottom, 
												exhausting its energy, and is added to a spent fuel container. 
												The heat generated from this process is converted to mechanical and then electrical energy to power cities.
												Working with a project partner, a study of the heat transfer rate between the pebbles in a pebble bed reactor and gas coolant was carried out using OpenFOAM. 
												OpenFOAM is a CFD tool similar to ANSYS but uses bash coding to perform tasks.

												<h3>The Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												For this simulation setup, different configurations for the pebble size, packing, and coolant flow were applied for each case. 
												The pebbles sizes used had diameters of 6cm (typical size) and 3cm, and 
												packing arrangements consisted of simple cubic, body-centered, and hexagonal closest. 
												These have packing factors of 0.52, 0.68, and 0.74, respectively. 
												The packing factor indicates the packing efficiency of a cell volume, where 0.52 means that the pebbles occupy 52% of the cell volume. 
												How would these factors affect the thermal output of the system?
											</p>
											<p>
												A constant domain size, inlet velocity, and pebble surface temperature was applied to the 12 case studies. 
												The most challenging part of this simulation was meshing the geometry successfully - bad meshes give incoherent results. 
												We utilized the snappyhexmesh feature which takes a block mesh and "snaps" it to a more refined one, 
												but this requires a very well defined mesh setting dictionary. 
												Any incorrect or unnecessary input in the lengthy dictionary leads to bad or failed meshes.
											</p>
											<p>
												After playing with the mesh and solver settings for each case and redoing cases showing result discrepancies and voiding, 
												we get axial slices of promising results.

												<h3>Challenges and Takeaways</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The difficult part of this project was learning how to use an open source CFD tool. 
												The software was new to me and had many resources and settings available, 
												so it was easy to get lost in text and confused on what to use in the study.
											</p>
											<p>
												Completing a variable matrix study taught what makes a simulation setup decent 
												(as my mentor would say, “trash in, trash out”), and workarounds for shortening the runtime. 
												It became easier to recognize artifacts in the results, and we could always check the literature values for reference.
