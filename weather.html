												<h3>The Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												During the development of a system, concerns were raised on its performance in extreme cold weather conditions. 
												Our team wanted to test the limits of its deployment subassemblies. 
												To approach this problem, servos were tested at extreme cold weather conditions both loaded and unloaded.
											</p>
											<p>
												To start, I was given different types of servos ripped out of salvaged drones. 
											</p>
											<p>
												I put together a testing rig to measure the performance of each servo motor: 
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>non-contact infrared thermal sensor to measure surface temperatures of the motor</li>
												<li>thermistor for ambient temperature</li>
												<li>hall effect potentiometer to record servo arm cycle speed</li>
												<li>an arduino as a controller</li>
												<li>and a data box coupled with its recording software</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												Many different conditions were applied to the test such as 
												starting the motor with a cold soak condition or shock temperature condition, 
												applying constant flight loads, 
												and stopping and starting the motor at different time intervals.
											</p>
											<p>
												To post-process this data, the software exported the data to an excel file. 
												MATLAB was used to import the data into organized elements, convert readings, 
												filter out outliers, place a moving average to smooth out noise, and plot the final curves. 
												While this could also be done in excel, it had filter and graphing limitations that would create very large, slow files.
											</p>
											<p>
												Overall, the results showed a strong correlation between lower temperatures and degraded performance. 
												These were observable physically within the motor and with graphs at startup - 
												high current indicating motor stress and stalling or a slow rise in current from the initial poor motor performance. 
												However, performance stayed consistent as long as the motor started and stayed warm by movement.

												<h3>Challenges and Takeaways</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												With the sensors being sealed in the cold soak chamber with the servo, 
												sometimes they would start to read incorrectly at test temperatures. 
												A lot of time was spent debugging errors in readouts - 
												sensors would show cold damage, larger voltage drops from the servo needed a workaround, 
												or maybe a solder contact would break over many test cycles.
											</p>
											<p>
												Thorough testing helped narrow down solutions to keep servo motors operational for launch. 
												Ultimately, power requirements to heat the system during idle time were looked into, 
												and the test scale was extended to a full system cold soak in a temperature controlled room.
