												<p>
													While at Area-I, I worked on the design and production of two types of UAV pneumatic launchers. 
													The rail launcher towed drones to takeoff speed, while the truck launcher mounted to a hitch and could cannon-launch UAVs. 
													With the rail launcher project, I was provided with a more in-depth engineering design experience for multiple subassemblies at once.
												</p>
												<p>
													A coworker designed the truck launcher during his time at the company, but left before he got the chance to see it built and function. 
													Picking up where he left off, a few minor changes were made and a mounting plate was designed.

												<h3>The Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												<b>The Rail Launcher</b>
												<br>
												The concept of the rail launcher is to send a small aircraft into flight using a pneumatic system. 
												There were many subassemblies: a cart to interface the aircraft to the rail, a piston for towing, 
												and a trailer that could handle shock loads from launches. 
												Since there was also a tight budget for the parts and labor, avoiding intricate designed parts was crucial.
											</p>
											<p>
												In its initial stages of design, 
												a concept CAD was put together within its sizing constraint to get a general idea of how large each subassembly may be, 
												and calculations for system shock loads, aircraft acceleration, and pneumatic pressures were done to help size and 
												pick potential parts throughout the process. 
												Alternative designs for every component even down to the screws and bearings were analyzed. 
												FEAs setup through SOLIDWORKS were done for critical parts. 
												Simulations can provide misleading values if set up incorrectly, 
												so its results were double and triple checked with hand calculations. 
												Using a validated analysis for design reviews provides a visual reference 
												and talking point for conveying why the design needs improvement or if it's acceptable. 
												Risks were also assessed not only for safety but also what steps to take 
												if a certain design aspect did not reach its goal for a critical deadline.
											</p>
											<p>
												Once the preliminary design was approved by our supervisor, 
												we moved onto testing and prototyping the pneumatic and towline assembly, 
												but this is where we started to run into some tolerancing issues. 
												While a small gap was accounted for between the piston head and its tube, 
												the length of the tube is just about as long as the rail. 
												We suspected sagging due to improper support during testing or just discrepancies in tubing diameter throughout the entire length, 
												but this caused the piston head to falter during its travel. 
												Adjustments were also made to plasma cut pieces of the cart since smaller tolerances were present around spacer and screw holes. 
												Other than fitment tests, data acquisition methods were utilized to measure upstream and downstream pressures, and piston exit velocity. 
												Even with these system inefficiencies present (and most predicted from earlier calculations), 
												the launching pneumatics still yield enough power to reach required launch velocities.
											</p>
											<p>
												Moving onto presenting these findings and later tweaking these designs, 
												drawing packages were put together to send out quotes to local manufacturing and machine shops. 
												All of the parts arrived in-house, and its final build was assembled and tested.
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>The Truck Launcher</b>
												<br>
												Usually prototype assemblies such as this one are quoted and sent to shop for production, 
												but its deadline was far out of the way. 
												This provided an opportunity to learn more about manufacturing processes and tolerancing.
											</p>
											<p>
												Since half of the assembly was plating with weight reduction holes, 
												these were waterjetted and deburred with ceramic tumbling. 
												The rest was tubing with adjustable pin holes. 
												While these were machined out on the mill, the hardest part was cutting the right length - 
												especially when the design calls for precise mounting angles. 
												The structure also needed to be welded in areas (aluminum being very difficult), introducing warping. 
												With these defects in mind, the final assembly was carefully put together ensuring that critical areas lined up correctly.
											</p>
											<p>
												After three weeks of machining, the launcher was ready to be tested. 
												A major concern that came to mind was whether the aluminum welds would hold up as they appeared to have poor penetration in certain areas. 
												It was driven out to a large field and connected to the hitch of a truck for testing. 
												Checking the assembly post-launch, we were happy to see that the assembly held up.

												<h3>Challenges and Takeaways</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The biggest challenge for this project was managing its short timeline. 
												It was a brand new system, and many risks were analyzed at each design milestone. 
												Since I was one of two engineers working on this project, the design focus shifted around multiple subsystems at once.
											</p>
											<p>
												The initial stages of this project were left with heavy documentation and testing data. 
												This was a good start if ever a new engineer needed to get up to speed on the project as it was the first rail launcher to have multiple configurations of ALTIUS launching. 
												There were successful launches of the ALTIUS 600 for both this rail launcher and the truck launcher. 
												The rail launcher will continue to design around ALTIUS 700 and 900 which were concept fuselages at the time of writing.
