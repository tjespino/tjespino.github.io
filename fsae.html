											<p>Formula SAE is a competition where engineering students collaborate in teams to design, test, and build a formula-style racecar. 
												While on KSU's FSAE team, my efforts were focused on the suspension subteam as a mechanical design engineer. 
												I slowly gained a better understanding of forces seen on the car to design and manufacture new control arms.
												Overall redesign goals included reducing subsystem weight, choosing a reasonable material, and improving tolerances and compliance, 
												all while meeting FSAE safety standards.

												<h3>The Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												With not much knowledge about control arms or even cars in general, 
												I started hitting the books and asking last year's members how and why they decided to build their current design. 
												Allegedly, it was just slapped together and it happened to work. 
												An alumni that worked on them previously had some design reasoning, but no paper trail was left behind. 
												Working with an experienced member, we started from scratch and thought of an approach for designing new ones.
											</p>
											<p>
												First we asked what are the biggest forces seen on them when the car is driving straight? 
												Accelerating? Braking? Cornering? Hitting a 2G bump? How much bending will they experience? 
												How many cycles of compression can they handle? What factor of safety do we use? 
												While working out the calculations on paper, I got updates from our brake's guy and vehicle dynamics lead on part and loading changes. 
												Recalculations were happening so often, I wrote a MATLAB code to save on time and hand cramps. 
												The numbers made sense, but they needed more validation.
											</p>
											<p>
												A finite element analysis study was setup in SOLIDWORKS using a material and tube thickness which matched the maximum stresses from hand calculations. 
												So the simulation works, but how does this compare to real life loading?

												I put together weldment drawings and machined a jig to notch and align the tubes at an angle for welding. 
												A custom clamp was also made to mount the specimen control arm in a static MTS machine for compressive and cyclical loads. 
												The stresses recorded during testing were similar to what was calculated. 
												Some discrepancies could be caused by the grade of chromoloy steel used and quality of the weld, 
												but the test still proved that in its current state, we have a working material and tube size.
											</p>
											<p>
												Custom spherical housings were machined (avoiding threaded rod ends that shear under bending loads) 
												using a lathe and ball joints were press-fit and tacked into place after welding together our finalized tube members. 
												With the control arms finished, they were installed onto the car.
											</p>
											<p>
												They fit. Mostly.
											</p>
											<p>
												Except when the steering was maxed out and the wheel well started to hit them.
											</p>
											<p>
												Oops.
											</p>
											<p>
												So we readjusted the angles and ran through loading validation which was faster the second time around, 
												and then built a new set.
											</p>
											<p>
												A successful fit.

												<h3>Challenges and Takeaways</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project was one of the first I thoroughly designed and built from concept to completion, 
												and the biggest challenge was the learning curve -
												studying up on vehicle dynamics, diving into machine operation and safety, and understanding 
												the importance of master CAD organization.
											</p>
											<p>
												By documenting the process, the team has a better foundation to use or reference back to for future builds. 
												I was happy to hear from younger members that they still use the code as a start for sizing their control arms. 
												With some food for thought on making the tube member calculator easier to use, 
												a prompt could ask or import the endpoint coordinates and give a library of saved materials to choose from.
