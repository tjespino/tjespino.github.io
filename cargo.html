												While at EDC, one of the larger R&D programs involved working with autonomous drones- 
												each with completely different chassis, propulsion systems, wing size, and overall purpose. 
												In the earlier stages, a drone surrogate was needed to collect baseline data while being reusable for flight testing. 
												I did mechanical design work for its frame, steering subsystem, propulsion mounting and cage, line control, and wing attitude sensor. 
												On its larger drone variant, I continued to work on sensors and its airdropped structure.

												<h3>The Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												As an ongoing project with a few years of involvement and watching it grow, there are a lot of subassemblies to talk about- 
												so I will just briefly go over a few I enjoyed working on.
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>Steering Control</b>
												<br/>
												For the hardware side, the steering system needed to be compact to fit within the bounds of the roll cage. 
												If there was damage during testing, it was easily accessible and replaceable. 
												With the frame geometry and available parts I was given, 
												this was doable as a parallel four-bar linkage setup so that the motor output directly matched the steering angle. 
												The motor needed to be backdrivable to calibrate its starting position, 
												but also have the ability to overcome forces at the contact patch during ground launching and landing without burning out. 
												This did come with its challenge of dealing with compliance stackup which only became worse with accidental damage. 
												Proper inspection and maintenance of any linkage loosening or gearbox backlash was addressed post-testing.
											</p>
											<p>
												An auto-steer controller was written which took in runway coordinates to keep the drone centered for takeoff, 
												and later, waypoints were added as target positions during flight. 
												Initial testing involved towing the drone which was the same method used previously for collecting data on GPS tracking and wing control.
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>Wing Attitude Sensor</b>
												<br />
												This measured the pitch and roll inputs of the paraglider without limiting its yaw motion. 
												These inputs were fed into the wing controller constantly for autonomous flight. 
												As a critical part of the system, the stackup needed to be easily replaceable and light, 
												but strong enough to withstand tension and bearing loads in the joints. 
												In its early stages, the mechanical range of motion was constantly tested- 
												if there was too much motion or too much limitation, what were its adverse effects on the wing controller? 
												Did any vibration or data noise impact the controller? 
												What faults should be placed in the system during improper calibration or launch failure?
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>Airdrop Structure</b>
												<br />
												As part of a larger scale project, I designed a new frame which houses the propulsion and avionics and attaches to a payload and guidance unit. 
												With the size and material cost, its design phase was heavy on structural analysis- 
												particularly on the shock tension loading seen during deployment and later on its torsional and vibrational loads when the propellor is on. 
												Working with the caveat of the project’s short lead times, parts needed to be easily sourced and readily available, or have backup alternatives. 
												I coordinated with contractors to tackle the work on analyzing smaller but critical sections of the frame like the payload attachment points and propulsion bracketry. 
												For the first baseline design, it needed to be outsourced to machine shops that could perform all of the manufacturing methods and tolerancing. 
												At the time of writing, it is undergoing preparation for its first flight test.

												<h3>Challenges and Takeaways</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												There were many environmental factors that affected testing- 
												What wind conditions brought the system to its limits? 
												What high temperatures can the avionics operate in before overheating? 
												How low can temperatures be before batteries die or fluids are too cold to start? 
												Will air moisture or morning dew affect the wing’s performance?
											</p>
											<p>
												Learning about paraglider physics was challenging as each has differing performance and reactive control. 
												Mimicking human inputs and translating that to autonomous control was even more challenging. 
												Understanding what causes noise or dropouts in the data was another beast to diagnose- 
												a bad sensor, blips in GPS, mechanical vibrations, CAN bus is busy, calibration is off, a degree of motion not accounted for. 
												How much noise should be filtered out?
											</p>
											<p>
												Mitigating any design and safety risks for flight tests were heavily accounted for. 
												A stop on a redesign iteration or postponing a flight test would occur if it meant less safety risks. 
												Proper pre-flight and post-flight checklists prevented mistakes as testing became more intricate.
											</p>
											<p>
												The current system is fully autonomous and was built upon the repeated failures and success of the surrogate done. 
												With a working baseline, its design has been scaled and reconfigured.
