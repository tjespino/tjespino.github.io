												While at EDC, our team was selected to compete after doing previous R&D work on derigging mechanisms.
												This autonomous derigging system must be compact, modular in mounting, and environmentally resilient.
												A large vehicle is air-deployed and after successful landing, the lashings are released within a target time of 5 seconds.
												For this project, I lead its mechanical design, testing and production.

												<h3>The Process</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												It was known that the competitor's system relied on a mechanical release (knife edge). 
												In contrast, ours used a thermal one (hot edge) which gave its own design challenges. 
												Much of its earlier prototyping stages explored hardware limits through bench testing.
												Several sizes and materials of the cutting feature, input current, cut time, and qualitative conditions were recorded, and hundreds of tests were plotted to build power curves.
												This gave our electrical engineers a clearer understanding of what power requirements the system needed and what to size the avionics components around.
											</p>
											<p>
												But as system limits were tested to find answers, even more questions arose:
											</p>
											<p>
												Which combination of hardware gives us the best efficiency? What's the fastest derigging time we can achieve with lower power?
												Too little power is a partial or full failure. Too much power easily gives us a quick release time but would mean larger components, heat damage, and more replacement or maintenance intervals.
											</p>
											<p>
												Can it still derig if the lashings are soiled from oil, dust, or water? If it's immersed? Submerged?
												Are the lashings allowed to be "pre-treated" if soiled conditions are expected?
											</p>
											<p>
												Does the system still function in extreme hot or cold conditions?
											</p>
											<p>
												How much impact or acceleration can it survive? Can it survive shock loads and vibrations from airdrop?
												Maybe the enclosures are fine, but what about the electronics?
												What if we change the mounting position?
											</p>
											<p>
												What is the expected lifecycle?
												Even if it's one-time use, do we want it to survive multiple runs for testing purposes?
											</p>
											<p>
												How do we select a reasonable cost-to-strength material?
												Can we improve the assembly process, sourcing, and turnaround?
											</p>
											<p>
												Is anything being tested outside of the project scope?
											</p>
											<p>
												With every iteration in design, some areas needed retesting as the overall system performance was honed in.
												Even midway through, there was an entire system redesign -
												which was very difficult and risky to pull off with such a short timeline but put us at a huge advantage.
											</p>
											<p>
												This overhaul gave us a much smaller power requirement, eliminated a critical failure point, and was faster with less hassle to setup.
												And as we learned later, a simpler user-friendly system means less mistakes from fatigue.
											</p>
											<p>
												With such a small power requirement, everything could be sized smaller and components were easier to acquire for improved lead times and cost.
											</p>
											<p>
												Since changes in the production process between each major airdrop test occurred often, a live assembly binder with instructions (essentially a lego manual)
												was put together to reduce confusion and improve production time. As kinks and delays in the production line were observed 
												(especially feedback from peers as they test-ran the build), more essential improvements were made: 
												concurrent assembly between subsystems such as avionics and mechanical hardware, quality checks and testing, and a proper production bench setup to prevent FOD.

												<h3>Challenges and Takeaways</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project gave me more responsibility and pressure in the overall planning, designing, and production of a system,
												especially when there was involvement and interaction with a larger competitor. As deadlines became tighter between each milestone, 
												risks and benefits were weighed before making a large redesign. Organizing a new production line and coordinating with other engineering teams
												was challenging as any miscommunication in the chain could be costly - which I learned quickly as the first production run was a disaster!
											</p>
											<p>
												As difficult as it was to take the reigns on this project from concept drawings to production, I am proud to say (and can confirm after talking to the client)
												that our system was more reliable, compact, and cheaper than our competitor's.
											</p>
											<p>
												And while the system evolves, more challenges will be encountered as functionalities are added and improved.
